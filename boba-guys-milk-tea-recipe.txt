Boba Guys Blend No.1
200 mL hot water (200F)
60 mL of milk
200 mL of ice
simple syrup

1. Brew a tea concentrate with the Boba Guys Blend No.1 tea: 2 tbsp in 200 ml of hot water for 8 minutes
2. Strain into 200 ml of ice
3. Add 60 ml of your choice of milk or dairy alternative (we like to use Straus Family Organic milk)
4. Sweeten your cup with your choice of sweetener. Our ideal cup consists of a brown sugar-based simple
syrup, but honey and agave are also excellent alternatives
5. Stir, pour over ice, sip and enjoy!
